QNixieNumber

This widget is an analogue of QLCDNumber, presented in the form of Nixie indicators. 
This widget has two styles: 
- computer graphics;
- imitation of a real indicator.
This widget allows you to set the style, the number of segments, pass the value for display, as well as get the current value (this method does not read the value from the images themselves).
